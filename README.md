## 📌 Project Information

- **English Name:** Smart Koi Farm Breeding and Sales Management System
- **Vietnamese Name:** Phần mềm quản lý sinh sản thông minh và bán cá Koi tại trang trại
- **Abbreviation:** SmartKoiBreeder

## 📖 Context

The Koi farm is currently facing challenges in managing the breeding and sales process:

1. Parent fish information is manually managed → risk of losing data and inbreeding.
2. Lack of data on breeding process → unable to calculate success/survival rate or efficiency.
3. Feeding and cleaning schedules are not synchronized among staff.
4. Customer records and sales orders are stored manually → difficult to search and summarize.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

SmartKoiBreeder is a **web & mobile application** that supports:

- Effective management of koi fish and breeding process.
- RFID-based tracking for unique fish identification.
- AI advisory system to suggest optimal breeding pairs.
- Sales management with customer order tracking and online purchasing.
- Health/environment monitoring for koi ponds.
